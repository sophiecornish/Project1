###### Goal:
Demonstrate skills acquired during my first 3 weeks of coding by creating a single page web game.

###### Technologies Used:
* HTML5 + HTML5 Audio
* Javascript (ECMAScript 6) + jQuery
* Git
* Github
* Animation
* Google Fonts   


###### Game Instructions:
Click Trump to make him disappear. Watch out, if you hit Obama, it's game over - if you hit Putin, you'll get a nasty surprise!  


As you progress through the levels there's more Trumps to dump & increasingly tricky features.
